## Overview

Your challenge is to build this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses on HTML & CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

About JS, you can choose to do it or not, depending on yourself.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
